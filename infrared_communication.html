            Infrared communication, which is also called infrared transmission, uses infrared light to transmit
            messages between devices. Infrared communication is a type of optical communication that uses the
            infrared portion of the electromagnetic spectrum.<br><br> Infrared light has a frequency that falls
            between visible red light and microwave radiation. It’s also just above the microwave range where
            water vapor and carbon dioxide absorb energy, so this area of the spectrum is often used for
            long-distance terrestrial communications.<br><br> The main advantage of infrared communication is that
            it doesn’t require line-of-sight between devices. This makes it ideal for military applications and
            surveillance systems.<br><br> Infrared signals can also travel through window glass and other
            transparent materials, so they’re useful in situations where radio waves would otherwise be blocked
            by walls or other obstacles.

      <h4><b>Examples of Infrared Communication</b></h4>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=remote+controls">Remote Controls</a><br></b>
          Remote control devices transmit commands via IR signals. For example, your TV remote sends instructions to
          your television via IR signals. The same applies to other household appliances like microwaves and air
          conditioners. This technology has been around since the 1960s and continues to be used today because it
          works well and requires no wires between devices. <br><br>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=ir+sensors">IR Sensors</a><br></b>
          IR sensors are used in many home security systems, such as burglar alarms or smoke detectors, in order
          to detect when an intrusion occurs or fire starts. These sensors send out an infrared signal that bounces
          off objects at varying angles depending on their distance from the sensor itself; this allows it to
          determine exactly where any movement is taking place around it so it can send out an alert if necessary.

            Microwave communication is the transmission of messages by modulating electromagnetic waves in the
            microwave frequency band.<br><br> Microwaves are a form of electromagnetic radiation, with frequencies
            from roughly 300 MHz (0.3 GHz) up to 300 GHz. The IEEE defines the broad range of frequencies from 0.3
            to 3 GHz as “microwave”, and above 3 GHz as “millimeter wave”.<br><br> Microwaves travel by line-of
            -sight transmission, which restricts them to short range communications, typically to an altitude of
            between 20 and 80 km.<br><br> This means that they must be aimed at an area rather than directly at
            an individual. They can pass through many physical obstructions such as buildings and trees that would
            attenuate typical radio waves.<br><br> They also tend to reflect off metal objects like cars and
            buildings, limiting the directionality of the signal. However, they can be focused by high gain
            antennas on narrow beams (e.g., for satellite communication) or spread out over wide areas
            (e.g., for aircraft navigation).<br><br> This allows them to be used in point-to-point links
            where there is no opportunity for a direct line-of-sight path between transmitter and receiver
            (such as mobile telephone links).

        <p>
          Microwaves are radio signals with a very short wavelength. Microwave signals can be focused by antennas
          just as a searchlight concentrates light into a narrow beam. Signals are transmitted directly from a source
          to a receiver site. Reliable microwave signal range does not extend very far beyond the visible horizon.
          <br><br> If microwave signals were visible to the eye, cities would be seen to be crisscrossed by microwave
          transmissions carrying important signals. Any type of information that can move over telephone wires or
          coaxial cables can be transmitted over a microwave circuit as efficiently as through the wires and cables
          they supplement.<br><br> <h5><b>Microwaves and power</b></h5> <br> The ability to focus microwave
          signals into narrow beams results in very high antenna gain. Antenna gain increases the effective-radiated
          power of a microwave signal much as the reflector in a flashlight produces a tight beam of light powerful
          enough to illuminate distant objects. The most common microwave-antenna focuses the signal by reflecting
          it from a parabolically-curved reflecting surface sometimes called a dish.<br><br> High antenna gain means
          that microwave transmitters need not be extremely powerful to produce a strong signal. A transmitter rated
          at 10 watts or less, using an antenna that concentrates the signal toward its target, can produce a received
          signal as strong as if thousands of watts were scattered in all directions. <br><br> <h5><b>Microwave
          transmitters</b></h5> <br> The lower-powered microwave signals used by communication transmitters are
          usually produced by solid-state devices. The Gunn diode is an example. When supplied with voltage from
          a well-regulated power supply these devices reliably produce a few watts of microwave signal.<br><br>

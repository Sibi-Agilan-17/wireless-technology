            Wi-Fi is a wireless communications technology that uses radio waves to provide high-speed Internet
            and network connections. It’s often used in homes, offices and public areas.<br><br> Wi-Fi transmitters
            — also called “base stations” — send and receive data using radio waves. To use Wi-Fi, you need to
            connect a device like a laptop or smartphone to the Internet using an access point (AP).<br><br> An
            AP can be set up by your internet service provider, or it can connect directly to the Internet
            through a cable or DSL modem. Some devices have built-in Wi-Fi antennas that let you connect to
            APs from a short distance away, while others require an adapter with an antenna that plugs into
            your device’s USB port.<br><br> Wi-Fi networks can be set up either as “open” or “closed.” Open
            networks are publicly available so anyone with a compatible device can join them and access the
            Internet through them; closed networks are password protected and only allow people who know the
            password to access them.

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=home+networks">Home Networks</a><br></b>
          Home networks allow you to access the internet over your home Wi-Fi connection. You can connect multiple
          devices to the same network, such as laptops, smartphones and tablets.<br><br>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wireless+hotspots">Wireless Hotspots</a><br></b>
          Many cafes and restaurants offer Wi-Fi hotspots for their customers’ use. These hotspots allow you to
          connect your device to the internet without using your own data plan or paying for access at the cafe
          or restaurant itself (which can get expensive). Some airports also offer free Wi-Fi hotspots so you can
          stay connected while traveling!<br><br>

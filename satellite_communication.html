            Satellite communication is the transmission of information between two or more points by means of an
            artificial satellite. The satellite used for communication can be either in a geosynchronous orbit
            or a low earth orbit.<br><br> The use of satellites for communication, commonly known as a
            space-based communication system, has enabled many technologies that were not possible before,
            such as satellite television and satellite radio.<br><br> Satellites are used for television
            broadcasting, telephone calls and other forms of communication. Satellites are also used for navigation
            (GPS), weather forecasting and atmospheric research.<br><br> Satellite technologies, like everything
            else in the field of electronics, have been continuously evolving to keep pace with the ever-increasing
            demand for more efficient and cost-effective satellites.

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=global+positioning+system">Global Positioning System (GPS)</a><br></b>
          GPS is an example of satellite navigation technology that helps people
          determine their location on Earth by using satellites orbiting our planet. People use GPS for activities such
          as hiking, boating or flying airplanes because it provides a reliable way to determine where they are in
          relation to other people or objects on Earth’s surface. <br><br>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=remote+sensing">Remote Sensing</a><br></b>
          Remote sensing is the process of collecting and analyzing data from remote locations.
          Satellites can be used to monitor weather conditions and natural disasters such as forest fires, earthquakes
          and volcanic eruptions, as well as to collect data about crop yields and water levels. <br><br>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=telecommunication">Telecommunication</a><br></b>
          Telecommunication refers to the transmission of information through a channel or
          network. Satellite telecommunications uses satellites to transmit information from one location to another
          over long distances at high speeds. This allows telephone calls, faxes and emails to be sent around the world
          in seconds instead of minutes or hours.<br><br>

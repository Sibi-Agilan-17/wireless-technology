            Bluetooth technology is a short-range wireless connection technology that enables the
            exchange of data between devices. The Bluetooth standard was developed by Ericsson,
            Nokia and Intel in 1994 to replace cables in mobile phones.<br><br>Today it’s used by
            billions of devices every day and has become an integral part of our lives. Bluetooth
            is used for many things, from connecting a phone to a car stereo system to pairing
            your smartphone with your smartwatch.<br><br>How does Bluetooth technology work?<br><br>
            Bluetooth works by using radio frequency (RF) signals to send information between
            devices over a distance of up to 100 meters (328 feet), but the range can vary
            depending on factors like interference from other wireless devices and physical
            barriers such as walls or doors.

      <h4><b>Examples of Bluetooth Technology</b></h4>
      <img src="./images/bluetooth_technology/jpg2.jpg" width="100px">
      <p>
          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=mobile+phones">Mobile Phones</a><br></b>
          Most smartphones have built-in Bluetooth radios that let them connect wirelessly with other devices such as
          headphones and speakers. If you want to listen to music or make a phone call while exercising outside or
          driving your car, this can be very convenient.<br><br>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=smartwatches">Smart watches</a><br></b>
          The Apple Watch has its own cellular connection so it doesn’t need to be paired with an iPhone. However,
          future Android Wear watches may not have cellular capabilities and may rely on Bluetooth instead — just
          like most smartwatches do today.<br><br>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wireless+headphones">Wireless Headphones</a><br></b>
          Headphones are one of the most common ways to use Bluetooth technology, especially if you’re an avid runner
          or biker who wants a hands-free experience while exercising. These headphones allow you to listen to music
          without having to carry your phone or MP3 player with you as you go about your day.<br><br>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wireless+keyboards">Wireless Keyboards</a><br></b>
          If you own a laptop or desktop computer and want an easier way of typing up documents and emails, then a
          wireless keyboard might be ideal for you!<br><br>

          <b><a href="https://www.google.com/search?q=wireless+speakers">Wireless Speakers</a><br></b>
          Wireless speakers are another way that people use Bluetooth technology on a daily basis. They’re convenient
          for parties and get-togethers because they allow users to play music from their phones or other devices
          without having to worry about wires getting tangled up or tripping over them.<br><br>

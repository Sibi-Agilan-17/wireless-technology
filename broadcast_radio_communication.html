            Broadcast radio communication is a system in which a broadcaster transmits the same signal
            at the same time to multiple receivers.<br><br>The broadcast medium may be a wire or cable,
            but it is now increasingly wireless. Broadcast radio is an old technology, dating back to
            radio’s roots in the early 20th century.<br><br>In its infancy, broadcast radio was used to
            transmit music and news from one location to another. As time went on, many different types
            of broadcasts were created and developed to suit different needs and interests.<br><br>Today’s
            broadcast radio includes talk shows, sports events, weather forecasts, traffic reports,
            emergency broadcasts and much more.
